- log files mark as %ghost (it will be good add ASAP logrotate support for
  this files) - using %ghost determines initialize this files in %post
  which determines adding fileutils o Prereq,
- move all %doc to main mackage ane removed doc subpackage.
- added passing FLAGS="%{rpmcflags}" and CC=%{__cc} (now spec is %{debug}
  ready and also well optimized and seems ready for crosscompilation),
- adde missing /sbin/chkconfig to Prereq,
- spec adapterized, cut %changelog and few other small cosmetics/simplifications.
